## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I found it very hard to use CSS Grid.I always tried to skip Grid for the layout.This Challenge encouraged me to learn CSS Grid and actually use it to create a Layout not like the ones we see in Tutorials.I also learned to create responsive layout with Grid.

### Continued development

I am still working on this project and trying to improve it by better Typography and adding animations

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
